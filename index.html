<h1>Hello, I'm Tifaine </h1>
<img src="images/profile.png" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Tifaine Pichon">
<p> I am a 22 year old student. I am currently doing a master in operations management at IESEG in La defense. I had the opportunity to do an exchange semester in Chile in 2018. Chile is the largest country in the world. This experience allows me to become more autonomous, to discover the chilean way of life and to adapt to other surroundings. If you want to see more details on this beautiful country, do not hesitate to check on the link below.</p>

<h2>My experiences</h2>
<p>During my studies, I had the chance to accomplish several internships. 
I had the opportunity to join Chronopost, a French leader in the fast delivery package which gave me a better understanding of a warehouse's issues and its strategic challenges. 
Then I worked for a fashion shop called Bel Air which showed me the importance of supply management and its correlation to customer satisfaction. Being in constant contact with the customer taught me to react under pressure and adpat to the client's needs. This allowed me to reach my selling goals while becoming problem-solving oriented.
Last year, I did a 4 month internship at BNP Paribas Securities Services to understand how a bank was working. I was a cash account manager intern and I was dealing with all the client's transactions.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>I have been president of the association Les outils de la RÃ©ussite which organizes events for underpriviliged children. It was really rewarding because I had to manage the organization of the weekly activities and my team. This project helped me to develop my leadership skills and my team spirit. 
During my free time I am also helping middle school students in their homework.
I like to do some sports such as: Dance, fitness,tennis and horse riding.
I had the chance to travel: Europe, The USA, Canada, Mexico, Vietnam, Philippines, South America.</p>
